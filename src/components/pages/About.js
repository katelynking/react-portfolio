            hello, I'm Kate!
            <br /><br/>
            I am a student at Middlesex College studying Computer Science. I enjoy designing websites, painting, yoga, and learning languages (trenutno uƒçim srpski). 
            <br /><br />
            Recently, I graduated from a Full Stack Web Development program, acquiring skills in CSS/HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MySQL, Express, React, Node, API and more. 
            <br/><br/>
            I also collaborated with a team of 5 to develop an online Family Cookbook application that allows users to upload their favorite family recipes.
